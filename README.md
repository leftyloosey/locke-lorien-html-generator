## Module 10 Roster Generator

The biggest project yet. It takes node/inquirer input from the command line and 
formats it in HTML to create a roster of imaginary people. Each person is 
generated from an employee class and role subclasses. A suite of unit tests
insure class methods and properties are all copacetic. 

This is a handy tool for someone who manages a team of imaginary people.
